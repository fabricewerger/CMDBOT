# CMDBOT
A discord bot made for CMD students, this is stil a work in progress because I still update it time to time.

THIS IS NOT A FINISHED PRODUCT

This is the source code for my discord bot aimed at CMD students. This is still a work in progress so some commands won’t work.

If you use this code the meme/kick command won’t work. Since you don’t have the library with the photos. Also I am working on the kick command to only work with the right roles.

If you have any questions, mail me or something.

Greetings,
Fabrice
